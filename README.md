# PSDMF Code
Matlab code for algorithms for positive semidefinite matrix factorization (PSDMF) based on singular value projection (SVP) and alternating block gradient (ABG) is available via https://dana.lahat.org.il/psdmf.html.
	
The above link contains the following files:
1. run_demo_psdmf.m (main file, start here)
2. psdmf.m (where the actual algorithms are implemented)
3. script_psdmf_functions.m (used by run_demo_psdmf.m to run the algorithms you choose in run_demo_psdmf.m)
4. script_draw_plots.m (figures for output of run_demo_psdmf.m)
5. psdmf_init.m (generate pseudorandom factors according to the PSDMF model)
6. psdmfgen.m
